# Freewheel FE-Test

To build this project you will require: NodeJS and Yarn or NPM.

## Commands

Running local:

 - `yarn install`: Installs all the dependencies

## Important:

I am using node-sass to enable SCSS modules, node-sass require a correctly version of Node to work properly:

NodeJS  | Minimum node-sass version | Node Module
--------|--------------------------|------------
Node 12 | 4.12+                    | 72
Node 11 | 4.10+                    | 67
Node 10 | 4.9+                     | 64
Node 8  | 4.5.3+                   | 57

As my machine is currently running Node 12, my node-sass is config as 4.12.
I also made sure to enable this in the docker file as well.
